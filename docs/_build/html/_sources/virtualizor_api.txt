## Usage

```python
from virtualizorAPI import Virtualizor_Enduser_API
```

#### Define the server

You should have virtualizor server and you need to obtain `apikey` and `apipass` for your account.

```python
testServer = Virtualizor_Enduser_API(apikey="Your_API_key",
                                     apiip="Virt_Panel_IP",
                                     apipass="Your_API_PASS",
                                     apiprotocol='http',
                                     apiport='4082')
```

You don't need `apiprotocol` and `apiport` if you use https, the defaults are set.

```python
testServer.listvs()
```

This call will return ID's of VPS's associated with your account, you will need VPS ID for other functions.

testServer.start(1003) # START server with ID 1003
testServer.stop(1005) # STOP server with ID 1005
