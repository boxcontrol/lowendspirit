Welcome to LowEndSpirit's documentation!
========================================

lowendspirit is an MIT Licenced library, writen in Python 3.

Why name lowendspirit? Look at http://lowendspirit.com/, I like that project.

So I needed library to call endpoints of API's for CloudFlare, SolusVM and Virtualizor. This library is part of making a panel for `lowendspirit users <http://forum.lowendspirit.com/viewtopic.php?id=2052>`_.

Panel is not finished yet ...

It has modules for sending API requests to CloudFlare, SolusVM and Virtualizor. It is intended to be used by end users.
All you need to do is get API Keys and API hashes to make it work.
